\section{Area and Perimeter of a Circle}
As before, the code to generate everything is available online at github at \url{https://github.com/neocpp89/16.930-ps2}.

The tables \ref{tbl:area1}, \ref{tbl:area2}, and \ref{tbl:perimeter} look mostly as expected, but the cubic seems to be off.
Looking at the difference tables in tables \ref{tbl:diffarea1}, \ref{tbl:diffarea2}, and \ref{tbl:diffperimeter} we see that there is indeed something strange.
I believe the calculation of the jacobian or normal must be done incorrectly, but my simple, lower order tests were not able to see the problem.

\section{Airfoil}
We see from figure \ref{fig:liftanddrag} that aside from a small blip at $\alpha = -3$, the analytical lift coefficient and the computed coefficient from differentiation the potential are very close together.
I expected less drag, but I don't have any real mathematical basis for that assumption (I know that in stokes flow, you don't get drag forces due to time reversibility, so I expected that to happen here).
I do see that there is a singularity at the trailing edge, and the pressure coefficient goes crazy there, so there is probably error due to that.

I cut down to range of the scalar plot (shown in figure \ref{fig:Cp}) for $\alpha = 10$ due to the aforementioned singularity at the trailing edge.
